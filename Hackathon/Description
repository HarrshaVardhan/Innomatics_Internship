About the Dataset
This dataset contains features of around 18,000 football players. You are expected to complete the following tasks. Use only numerical attributes to cluster the data.

*Task 1* - Data Visualization and Data Preparation
- You can use matplotlib and seaborn for visualization. This is an open ended task. For your comfort, below mentioned are the basic visualization you can start with:
- Plot histogram of count of players based on some attributes like height.
- Plot histogram and kde plots on attributes like ‘Value’ and ‘Wage’
- Use visualization techniques to find outliers like Ronaldo and Messi
- Distribution of players in different clubs/countries on the basis of some attributes
And many more….
- Try to perform below mention data transformations:
- Remove inconsistencies from ‘Value’ and ‘Wage’ columns
- Missing Values and Outliers treatment


Task 2 - K Means
- Implement k-means clustering. Choose k = 3, 5, 7
- Use only numeric attributes to cluster
- Use elbow method and Silhouette Score to get optimal number of clusters
- Analyse the results/clusters formed(in every case above) based on the following parameters:
- How good are the clusters? Use inter and intra class similarities to measure the goodness of clusters
- Find any hidden patterns if any
